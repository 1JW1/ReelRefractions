I write about films the way I experience them — through feeling first, analysis second. Some reviews are instinctive, others dig deeper into the craft and context. Most are a messy mix of both, just like cinema itself.

Reel Refractions is a space for spontaneous reflections on cinema — emotional, instinctive, and sometimes messy, just like film itself.
