## The Blog

Reel Refractions isn't about star ratings or box office numbers. It's about what happens when a film gets under your skin — that image you can't shake, the line of dialogue that rewires how you think, the cut that makes you sit up straighter. I'm drawn to the moments that refract through you long after the credits roll.

## What to Expect

You'll find a mix here. Some pieces are quick gut reactions written while the film is still fresh. Others take their time, pulling at threads of cinematography, sound design, or narrative structure until something interesting unravels. I cover new releases, revisit older films that deserve another look, and occasionally chase whatever obsession the algorithm didn't serve me.

There's no single genre or era I stick to. If it's compelling, it's fair game.

## The Author

I'm Erwin Bernard. Film has been a constant in my life for as long as I can remember — not as a profession, but as a way of seeing. This blog is where I put that into words.

For quick takes on films I haven't written up here yet — and the latest updates that eventually make their way to the blog — you can find me on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/1eb1/).
