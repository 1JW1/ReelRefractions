## The Blog

Reel Refractions isn't about star ratings or box office numbers. It's about what happens when a film gets under your skin — that image you can't shake, the line of dialogue that rewires how you think, the cut that makes you sit up straighter. I'm drawn to the moments that refract through you long after the credits roll.

I write through feeling first, analysis second. That means some pieces are gut reactions scrawled while the projector light is still in my eyes. Others pull at threads — cinematography, sound design, the structural choices that make a scene work or collapse — until something interesting unravels. Most are a messy mix of both, because the best films resist clean separation.

## What to Expect

Reviews here fall into a few modes:

- **New Releases** — first impressions, spoiler warnings where relevant, written fast while the feeling is fresh
- **Revisits** — films I've returned to after years away, or after something changed in the cultural context around them
- **Retrospectives** — deeper dives into older films that deserve more serious attention than they usually get
- **Quick Takes** — short-form gut reactions, no section headings, no verdict box; just a tight burst of feeling and a closing line

There's no single genre or era I stick to. If it's compelling, it's fair game. What I won't write about: films I haven't seen, films I walked out of (that's a different kind of review I'm not interested in writing), and whatever the algorithm tells me I should care about.

## How I Watch

Mostly alone, in the dark, with my phone face-down. I take no notes during a viewing — that habit killed my enjoyment of too many films. I watch first. I think after. Occasionally I'll watch something twice before writing, usually when the first impression felt slippery or dishonest.

I don't have a background in film criticism or an academic frame I'm working from. I have years of watching, a reasonably good memory for scenes, and an instinct for when something is working and when it isn't. Take that for what it's worth.

## The Author

I'm Erwin Bernard. Film has been a constant in my life for as long as I can remember — not as a profession, but as a way of seeing. This blog is where I put that into words.

I'm not trying to be right. I'm trying to be honest. If I've got it backwards, I genuinely want to hear it.
