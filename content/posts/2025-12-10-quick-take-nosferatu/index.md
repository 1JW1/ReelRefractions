Robert Eggers shoots the way certain composers conduct: with absolute control of tempo, dynamics, and silence. Every frame of *Nosferatu* is considered. You feel it in the light — the way it falls through curtains in oblique slabs, the way darkness is never just darkness but something with texture and weight. He's made the best-looking horror film in years, possibly the best-looking film of 2024, and he's done it by understanding something most directors forget: the monster is not the horror.

The horror is the wanting.

Lily-Rose Depp, as Ellen Hutter, carries the film's emotional core in a performance that refuses to be understood. She's not the typical horror protagonist — reactive, terrified, in need of rescue. She's magnetised. Something in her reaches for what she's supposed to be fleeing, and Depp plays that ambivalence without explaining it. It's unsettling in the best possible way.

Bill Skarsgård as Orlok is the most physically committed monster performance in recent memory. Buried under prosthetics and whatever choices he's making with his body, he creates something genuinely wrong — a presence that your eye resists settling on, like looking directly at something you shouldn't. The voice is extraordinary. The movement is extraordinary. This is the kind of performance that doesn't get enough credit because it's wearing a costume.

The pacing is deliberate, which is Eggers' only mode. If you find *The Lighthouse* or *The VVitch* too slow, this won't convert you. But if you're willing to stay in the tempo he sets, the final act earns something most horror films don't bother to reach for — a genuine sense of tragedy rather than resolution.

It's not perfect. Some of the supporting characters feel thinly sketched against the intensity of the central triangle. The middle act loses some momentum during its Transylvania sequences. But these are small complaints against a film that does what it came to do with complete conviction.

*Nosferatu* is a film about the terror of your own desire. Eggers understands that completely.

**4 / 5** — See it in a cinema, in the dark, with the sound turned up.
