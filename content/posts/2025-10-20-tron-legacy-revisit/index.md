I tried to rewatch *Tron: Legacy* before seeing *Tron: Ares* and stopped about thirty minutes in. I wrote as much in [my Ares review](/posts/2025-10-13-tron-ares/). That was in October. A few weeks later, I came back and watched the whole thing.

I was more patient this time. It helped.

## What I Got Wrong

*Legacy* is not, as I remembered it, a film that fails at everything except visuals. It's a film that succeeds completely at exactly one thing — *atmosphere* — and then builds everything else around a chassis that can't support the weight.

The atmosphere is extraordinary. Lisberger's original *TRON* has a naïve, hand-crafted quality that makes it feel like someone's fever dream of what computers might feel like from the inside. *Legacy* makes the same world slick, cold, and magnificent. The Grid as rendered by Joseph Kosinski is one of the most fully realised digital environments ever put on screen: a neon-lit monochrome dystopia where everything has weight and shadow and the physics feel alien but consistent.

And then there's the Daft Punk score.

I've come around to thinking that Daft Punk's *Tron: Legacy* soundtrack is genuinely one of the greatest scores of the twenty-first century. Not the greatest in a *Ennio Morricone composing for Leone* sense — but in the sense that it's perfectly calibrated for what it's doing. It doesn't support the film: it *is* the film. When the score is playing and the neon is moving and nobody is talking, *Legacy* is a near-perfect sensory experience.

The problem is that somebody keeps interrupting with dialogue.

## The Weight the Film Can't Carry

Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn is not a bad actor — he's a fine actor given nothing to work with. Sam is written as reactive rather than active: things happen to him, revelations are made to him, choices are presented to him. He never becomes the protagonist of his own story.

The father-son dynamic with Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is the film's emotional centre and its weakest point. Bridges is doing something genuinely interesting — a digital messiah who's had too long to think and has drifted from visionary to mystic — but the script doesn't know what to do with him. His philosophy is a fog. His decisions are inconsistent. He exists to deliver exposition and then, at the end, sacrifice himself in a way that doesn't earn its emotion because we never quite understood what he stood for.

Compare this to Ares, where Jeff Bridges does considerably less and lands considerably harder, precisely because the film doesn't ask him to be the meaning.

## The Daft Punk Theorem

Here's what I think happened: *Legacy* was greenlit on the strength of the original's cult reputation and a director whose background was in stylised visual work. The visual production was extraordinary. The score was extraordinary. The script wasn't.

This is more common than it should be. When everything surrounding the story is doing its job beautifully, the story's absence is both obvious and forgivable — audiences want to return to the experience even when they can't articulate exactly what they're returning for.

*Legacy* made $400 million globally on a $170 million budget. It underperformed. That's the proof: people went, got the experience, and didn't come back. *Ares*, as of its opening weekend, has earned less. But I think *Ares* will age better, because it gave us a story worth returning to rather than an atmosphere worth re-entering.

## What a Second Viewing Reveals

The film is more interesting about Clu than I remembered. Clu — Kevin Flynn's programme turned authoritarian — is genuinely menacing in a way that the film never quite capitalises on. His "perfecting the Grid" philosophy, a rigid algorithm applied to living systems, is a more interesting AI anxiety than *Legacy* deserves credit for.

The ISO subplot — genetically evolved programmes emerging spontaneously from the Grid — is the film's most ambitious idea and its most undercooked. It's mentioned, venerated, and then resolved without consequence.

But I watched all of it this time. The score carried me when the story didn't. That's something.

## Verdict

**3 / 5** — A second watch reveals a more interesting film than I remembered, and a more frustrating one. The atmosphere is unmatched. The script is the wrong film wearing the right suit.

**Best for:** Anyone who wants to understand what *Tron: Ares* was reacting against — and why getting it right mattered.

**Skip if:** You need story to match spectacle. Legacy will disappoint you, and that disappointment doesn't improve with distance.
